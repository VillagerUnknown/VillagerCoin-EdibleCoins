# VillagerUnknown's Edible Coins Addon for Villager Coin

Adds a custom currency, Villager Coin, and optionally adds the currency to loot tables, mob drops, and merchant trades.

Villager Coin consists of 5 types of coins each with their own value: Copper, Iron, Gold, Emerald, and Netherite. 
It also includes 3 types of edible coins to trick players: Gold, Emerald, and Netherite. 

Each type of coin stacks up to 5,000 coins by default to reduce inventory clutter and can be converted between the different coins through the crafting table.
The stack size can be configured, but it's limited to a maximum of 1073741822.
